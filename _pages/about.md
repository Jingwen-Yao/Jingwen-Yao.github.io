Hi, I am Jingwen Yao (姚婧雯 in Chinese). I am currently a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Radiology & Biomedical Imaging at UCSF. My research interest focuses on the development and validation of advanced MRI techniques for applications in brain tumors and other neurological diseases.

Please see my [CV](https://jingwen-yao.github.io/files/Jingwen_CV.pdf) here.
