Hi there! My name is Jingwen Yao (姚婧雯 in Chinese) and I am a neuroimaging researcher with a passion for translating advanced MRI techniques for the application in brain tumors and other neurological disorders. I received my Ph.D. in Bioengineering from UCLA and trained as a postdoctoral researcher at UCSF. I am currently an Assistant Professor at UCLA and my research interest focuses on developing, implementing, and validating imaging biomarkers for glioma and Huntington's disease patients using advanced MRI (pH-sensitive chemical exchange saturation transfer imaging, sodium MRI, quantitative susceptibility mapping, etc.) and improving the targeting of functional neurosurgery in patients with movement disorders. I am dedicated to using my expertise in neuroimaging to advance our understanding of brain diseases and improve patient care through precision medicine. In my free time, I enjoy hiking and origami. Thank you for visiting my personal website, where I document my professional journey.

We are always looking for highly motivated and talented graduate students and postdocs to join our team. We offer a dynamic and collaborative research environment, with opportunities for students and postdocs to develop their skills and gain hands-on experience in neuroimaging acquisition, processing, and analysis. We are seeking candidates with a strong background in Bioengineering, Electrical Engineering, Neuroscience, Medicine, or a related field, and a passion for clinical oriented neuroimaging research. If you are interested in joining our team, please send a copy of your CV to jingwenyao@mednet.ucla.edu. We look forward to hearing from you!
