Hi there! My name is Jingwen Yao (姚婧雯 in Chinese) and I am a neuroimaging researcher with a passion for developing and translating advanced MRI techniques for the application in brain tumors and other neurological disorders. I received my Ph.D. in Bioengineering from UCLA and trained as a postdoctoral researcher at UCSF. I am currently an Assistant Professor at UCLA and my research interest focuses on developing imaging biomarkers for glioma patients using advanced MRI (pH-sensitive chemical exchange saturation transfer imaging, sodium MRI, quantitative susceptibility mapping) and improving the targeting of functional neurosurgery in patients with movement disorders. I am dedicated to using my expertise in neuroimaging to advance our understanding of brain diseases and improve patient care through precision medicine. In my free time, I enjoy hiking and origami. Thank you for visiting my personal website, where I document my professional journey.
